# Smashing Magazine Visual Hierarchy 
This is a "heat" map of the [Smashing Magazine homepage](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) that indicates the
different element weights in the visual hierarchy.

This is a project as described in [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-teardown).
